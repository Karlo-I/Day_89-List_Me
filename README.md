Below is a self-reflection I have submitted to the course provider after completing the project, which I believe will help provide background for this repository.

Reflection:

This project has been the most challenging and the most time-consuming tutorial I’ve worked on so far.

The hardest part was probably figuring out where to start. I looked at a few examples but ultimately opted for one with the simplest design, from which I drew my inspiration.

In this capstone, I encountered many challenges, especially in terms of UX/UI design and debugging the Python code.

Luckily, I found ChatGPT useful when I faced serious technical errors. However, I would also caveat this by saying that ChatGPT can pose real challenges, as its suggestions do not always provide what I need. Sometimes, the process requires many iterations before I find the correct solution.

I realized my weakness in dealing with HTML and CSS only during this tutorial, so I dedicated more time to understanding them in this project. I believe I have made significant progress and improved my front-end development skills.

Once I felt more or less comfortable with the web application, I asked a friend who works as a UX/UI designer for feedback.

Her feedback was incredibly useful, as it helped me consider aspects I might have otherwise overlooked. After implementing her suggestions, I made the website more user-friendly and interactive while maintaining the simple design.

I’m aware of a few issues that I believe I can still improve. If I were to tackle a similar project in the future, I would likely spend more time planning the overall structure of the webpage before diving into the coding.
